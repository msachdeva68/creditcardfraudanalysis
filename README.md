# Credit Card Fraud Prediction

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)



This project aims to develop a credit card fraud prediction system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can effectively identify and flag potential instances of credit card fraud based on historical transaction data.

## Business_Problem

A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.


## Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.10.12

numpy 1.23.5

matplotlib

seaborn

sklearn


### Installation

Check and run the code by following these general steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   The person interested in running your code needs to clone your GitHub repository. They can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:

    Copy code
    gh repo clone msachdeva68/Credit_Card_Fraud_Prediction


3. Open the Colab Notebook:
   After cloning the repository, the person can navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned and open the Colab notebook (typically a file with a .ipynb extension). If you are using Colab, it's likely that your notebook has the .ipynb extension.

4. Run the Notebook:
   Once the Colab notebook is opened, they can run the code cells by clicking on the "Run" button next to each cell or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter. If there are any dependencies or external files required, they might need to be installed or downloaded as well.

5. Check the Results:
   After running the notebook, the person can check the output and results generated by the code. This might include visualizations, printed output, or any other results produced by your code.

6. Handle Dependencies:
   If your Colab notebook relies on external libraries or dependencies, make sure to include instructions on how to install them. This could be done in a separate cell at the beginning of your notebook.

7. Handle Data:
    If your code relies on specific datasets, make sure they are available or provide instructions on how to download them.
