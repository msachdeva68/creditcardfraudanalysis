This project aims to develop a credit card fraud prediction system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can effectively identify and flag potential instances of credit card fraud based on historical transaction data.

## Business_Problem

A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.


## Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.10.12

numpy 1.23.5

matplotlib 3.7.1

seaborn 0.13.1

sklearn 1.2.2




### Installation

Check and run the code by following these general steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   The person interested in running your code needs to clone your GitHub repository. They can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:

    Copy code
    gh repo clone /msachdeva68/creditcardfraudanalysis


3. Open the Colab Notebook:
   After cloning the repository, you can navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned and open the Colab notebook (typically a file with a creditcardfraudanalysis.ipynb extension). 

4. Run the Notebook:
   Once the Colab notebook is opened, you need to run the code cells by clicking on the "Run" button next to each cell or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter. 

5. Check the Results:
   After running the notebook, you can check the output and results generated by the code. This might include visualizations, printed output, or any other results produced by your code.

6. Handle Data:
   In case you facing any issue with datase then you can download it from the below link and change the path in notebook where "df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Data/Capstone Project/Virtual Voice Assistant/Credit_Card_Fraud/creditcard.csv')"   mention with path.

## Usage

We have build a model the check the credibility of a person using credit card. It will help us to track down the fraud transcation goin on regular basis. 
We tried using multiple model to find the best model to predict the transction status.

## Features

We have a imbalance dataset so we took sample from high target feature and joined the both target feature.
After the we used random forest classifier, decision tree classifer, Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier and XG Boost. We have found Logistic Regression and XG Boost gave as the best resul so far. 
So we are going to use XG Boost as a prediction model for future references.

## Contributing

Anyone who like to give us any suggestion or recommendation based on our model. We really appreciate and ready to get that for futur references.
